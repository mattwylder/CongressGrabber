# CongressGrabber

Script to parse Congressional vote tallies from the House of Representitives. Currently hard coded for a specific role call vote, not currently flexible enough to handle Senate votes or differently formatted House votes.

House Clerk data formatting is odd. Parties are designated with italics! Strange.
